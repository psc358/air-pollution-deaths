Air pollution deaths data ETL and profiling repo

This repository contains the cleaning and profiling MapReduce jobs to clean the 'number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor.csv' dataset found on Our World in Data. These jobs are run on HDFS. This ETL process is intended to help us query the data to find trends in air pollution deaths over the last 30 years.
